I picked up _The Haunting of Hill House_ on yet another whim at my local library. I guess I just wasn’t ready to let Halloween die.

I thought the book was good, even great. But a lot of reviews have called it the best haunted house novel ever written. I wasn’t moved that much. The beginning was definitely creepy with a great sense of dread.

The book is well written and the characters are more than just plot devices. The protagonist Eleanor is one of the most peculiar characters I’ve read in a while. She has psychological issues and might not be a good person. She steals her sister’s car in the beginning of the book for example. She also might be one of the most relatable characters for me. In the beginning at least, she will marvel at herself with how well she’s fitting in with the group. She’ll also simultaneously be jealous at the ease some of the others have at making conversation. As an awkward type myself, I’ve had this exact self doubting inner conversation as well.

Great descriptions, intriguing characters, and some solid atmosphere makes this a great Halloween novel.
